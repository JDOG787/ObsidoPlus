A web scraping/crawling bot that watches for recent news articles and sends an SMS telling you which stocks to invest in.

## How it works 
Basically it web scrapes news sites like foxnews for new articles about stocks and crypto, processes the article content and determines wether the article is relevent or not. If it is then it will alert you, telling you you should invest.

## Why it works
The idea is that when an article comes out about stocks/something that might cause stocks to rise, stocks often go up 2%-4%.
